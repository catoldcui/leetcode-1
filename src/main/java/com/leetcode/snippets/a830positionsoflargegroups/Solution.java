 *
 * Desc:
 * =====
 * In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
 *
 * For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".
 *
 * Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.
 * We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.
 *
 * The final answer should be in lexicographic order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
 * Output: [[3,6]]
 * Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
 * Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
 *
 *
 * Note:  1 <= S.length <= 10000
