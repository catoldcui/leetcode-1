 *
 * Desc:
 * =====
 * Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it.
 * If no such solution, return -1.
 *
 * For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
 *
 * Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”),
 * B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
 *
 * Note:
 * The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
